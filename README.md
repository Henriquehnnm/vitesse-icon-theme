## About The Theme

Vitesse (a portmanteau of _Vitesse_ and _Vite_) is a file icon theme for VS Code designed to be clean, modern, and easily readable. It provides a comprehensive set of icons for a wide range of file types, frameworks, and tools, with both dark and light variants to match your favorite color themes.

The icons are designed with a minimalist aesthetic, using a consistent color palette and style to provide a visually pleasing and non-distracting coding environment.
